              Can't get enough of the classic Filipino sinigang? Try this fried
              rice version that's packed with the same tangy goodness.
            </p>
            <p>
              Filipinos are heavy rice eaters, so its almost impossible to see a
              Filipino breakfast spread without a large platter of rice. As
              smart budgeters, Filipinos like to turn last nights leftovers into
              the next mornings breakfast. The best way to breathe new life to
              stale, day-old steamed rice is to fry it with lots of garlic and
              scrambled eggs.

            <p>
              Scrambled eggs may seem basic, but theres nothing basic about
              these ones. Filipinos like to add a little something to their
              morning eggs for extra flavor: onions and tomatoes. If you think
              theres nothing exciting about these scrambled eggs, think again.
              The tomatoes and onions add sweetness and texture, transforming
              the simple dish from meh to memorable.

                Make sure to whisk the eggs very well to aerate and add volume,
                creating lighter and fluffier curds. The beaten eggs should be
                of uniform yellow color, with the whites and yolks completely
                incorporated together.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cook the eggs at low heat. High temps will make the eggs
                “seize,” resulting in hard, dry scrambled eggs.
              </li>
              <li>
                Turn off the heat while the eggs are still slightly wet as they
                will continue to cook with the residual heat from the pan.

                Flip the omelet with the aid of a wide spatula and then cook the
                other side for 3 minutes. Note: If you are having a hard time
                flipping the omelet, try to first place the egg on a wide plate
                (the cooked side should be facing down). Quickly flip the plate
                on top of the pan so that the omelet will slide to the pan with
                the uncooked side facing down.
